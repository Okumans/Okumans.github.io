    <CardDescription>
      I'm a student at Chulalongkorn University with a passion for system
      programming, backend development, and embedded systems. Currently, I'm
      exploring Rust and starting with Go, building on a strong foundation in
      data structures, algorithms, and core programming concepts. I enjoy
      solving challenging problems and constantly strive to improve my skills.
